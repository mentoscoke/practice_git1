This is a pracice readme file for my understanding.

2021-09-23
- create a new private repository on github.com

- create a clone from web onto a local machine.
- edit readme.md

then
- committed locally, then pushed.

then 
- create a new branch dev with "git checkout -b dev"
- edit readme.md again

then 
- create another branch dev2 locally, with using checkout function in smartgit
